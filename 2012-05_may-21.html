<p>Royalty free contribution... seems obvious</p>
<p>Internationalization Notes...</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How will spec compliance be enforced?</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&quot;Best Fit&quot; (Language, Date-Time Format Negotiation)

  - Browser A vs. Browser B, what is a best fit?

  There are tests, but things being &quot;unspecified&quot;

  This will give birth to unpredictability which
  in turn forces web developers to shim the
  &quot;predictability&quot;.
</code></pre>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-review Internationalization &quot;poke holes&quot;</li>
<li>Section 13 DateTimeFormat Objects</li>
